Define your tasks and then execute them at the click of a button in your taskbar.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following setting:

- `VsCodeTaskButtons.showCounter`: Boolean to show/hide the Task counter. Default true.
- `VsCodeTaskButtons.tasks`: Array used to define tasks. See below for format.

### Task button configuration format
For each button you define the following object:

```
{
  "label": "Label that appears in the taskbar",
  "task": "The vscode task to execute. Must be absent when using 'tasks'",
  "tasks": "List of tasks to show in the Quick Pick Menu",
  "tooltip": "Optional tooltip to show when hovering over the button (defaults to task name)",
  "description": "A description of the task when viewing the task list in the Quick Pick Menu"
}
```

#### Icons

You can add icons to your buttons using the following syntax in the text field:

    $(icon-name)

A list of all available icon names (sourced from the VSCode theme) is [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels#icon-listing)

Icons are not supported in the tooltip text.

#### Emoji

You can add Emoji's to the button text and tooltip text.
Just type an emoji as you would any normal character opening your "emoji keyboard" ([Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-keyboard-tips-and-tricks-588e0b72-0fff-6d3f-aeee-6e5116097942) [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-emoji-and-symbols-on-mac-mchlp1560/mac))

You can also copy them from [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/)

### Example configuration

The following example gives you three buttons (Build, Rebuild and Clean) with icons and emojis. when placed in you projects settings.json

```
{
    "VsCodeTaskButtons.showCounter": true,
    "VsCodeTaskButtons.tasks": [
        {
